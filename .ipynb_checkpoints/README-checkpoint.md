# MSc-Neuroscience-Python-Course-Development

Welcome to the pre-material of the **MSc Translational Neuroscience**! The aim of the material is to introduce you to programming in Python and to statistics. If you have already experience with programming and/or statistics, then this will be only an easy review. If not, it will give you the necessary foundation to be able to complete the modules in the MSc smoothly. read th
