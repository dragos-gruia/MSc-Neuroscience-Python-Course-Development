# Pre-material of the MSc Translational Neuroscience
## Introduction to Python programming and statistics

Welcome to the pre-material of the **MSc Translational Neuroscience**! The aim of the material is to introduce you to `programming in Python` and to `statistics`. If you have already experience with programming and/or statistics, then this will be only an easy review. If not, it will give you the necessary foundation to be able to complete smooothly the modules in the MSc.
```
Read the instructions carefully before starting the lectures
```

You are expected to go trough the material in the following order:

1. **Statistical theory and decision tree**: we prepared for you a brief overview of the main statistical tests and concepts, as well as a *decision tree* that directs you towards the most appropriate statisticals test to use based on your research question and data types. You should go through the theory of statistics as first task.

    > **IMPORTANT**: to be able to complete the last day of the Python lectures (Day10 on statistics), you must have completed the statistical theory. You can work on the the other 9 coding lectures in parallel with the statistical theory, if you prefer.

2. **Device set-up**: there are two documents called `mac_set-up` and `windows_set-up`. Follow the instructions in the document that correspond to your operative system. If you have any questions about the set-up specifically, you can contact Dragos Gruia and Valentina Giunchiglia.

3. **Introduction to Python**: we prepared 10 separate lectures on the most important concepts of programming in Python. The lecture are called DayN (where N correspond to the number of the day) and are already in the order in which you should complete them.
    > **IMPORTANT**: don't skip lectures, but do follow the order we provided, because following lectures are based on previously taught material.

    > **IMPORTANT 2**: The lecture are characterised by a combination of *pratical theory* and *code here* sections. The *code here* sections require you to apply what you have learnt in the lectures through small exercises.

    A summary of the lectures' topics is provided in the following Table.

1. **Exercises**: when you completed **both** the *statistical theory* and the *programming* lectures, you can continue to complete the 5 exercises that we have prepared for you. The exercises require you to know everything we have mentioned in the lectures (both programming and statistics) and consist in analysing and preparing some real-data on cognitive behaviour, that we collected as part of the *Great Britain Intelligence Test (GBIT)*. We suggest you to solve the each exercise in a separate `Jupyter Notebook`. 


    > **IMPORTANT**: In the week between the - and -, we will open a `Q&A` on Blackboard where you will be able to post questions about the lectures and the exercises. The `Q&A` will remain open for **ONE WEEK**. During this week, you have the opportunity to ask all the questions you might have. at the end of the week, we will reply to all the questions on Blackboard. If we believe that one question might require longer explanations, we will schedule calls with all the students that facing the same issue.
