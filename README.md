# MSc-Neuroscience-Python-Course-Development

This is the repository for creating learning materials for MSc Translational Neuroscience. I added below the structure for the pre-materials. As we make changes or finish certain parts of the tutorial, we can do a line-cross or a tick next to each section to signal that it's done.

1.	**DAY 1: Python Syntax**
    -  Variables
    - Arithmetic operations
    - Strings
    - Print statements
    - Booleans
    - How to open/write files
    - Common Errors and how to identify them
    - Exercises
2. **DAY 2:Python Functions**
    - Structure and definition
    - Calling a function and returning values
    - Single and multiple parameters functions
    - Scope of variables (local vs global)
    - Exercises
